## Actual "Robinhood Fake API" API docs

It returns the API key's portfolio value taking into account how much of the given stock they own. For eg: 44 AAPL stocks would return AAPL value times 44. It knows the ownership amount. 

#### Notes
- API enforces a strict rate-limit of 10 requests per API key
- You can view the current rate-limit in the response header

#### Get price quote for a specific stock

#### Reset the rate-limit for an API key (don't use this in the solution!!)

`curl --header "api-key: test-key" https://fakedaq-api.onrender.com/reset`

Response
